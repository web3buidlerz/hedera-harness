 * machinery exists and how to avoid needing it. The evaluator clicked Connect,
 * the app generated its own burner wallet, and funding *that* address was the
 * hard part: known only at runtime, and needing a signed transfer. Making the
 * supplied account be the wallet removes the step entirely, because a person
 * already funded it at the portal.
 *
 * So the harness holds the account id — to read a public balance — and passes
 * the key through to the evaluator without ever using it. No SDK, no
 * provisioning, and the key never enters the harness's own logic.
